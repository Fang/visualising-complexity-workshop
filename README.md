# Visualising complexity datasets


## Introduction

This repository contains code and data for working with datasets for the SEFARI visualising complexity workshop <https://visualisingcomplexity.wordpress.com>.


## Datasets

These datasets were taken from <http://statistics.gov.scot>.
Visit the website for more datasets, but remember to concentrate on data visualisation, not data acquisition and preparation!


* `population-estimates-historical-geographic-boundaries`  <http://statistics.gov.scot/data/population-estimates-historical-geographic-boundaries> Mid-year population estimates. Higher geographies are aggregated from 2001 Data Zones.
* `electricity-consumption.csv` <http://statistics.gov.scot/data/energy-consumption> Consumption (GWh) by energy (electricity) and customer type (all)
* `renewable_electricity_percent.csv` <http://statistics.gov.scot/data/renewable-electricity> Electricity generated by renewables as a percentage of gross consumption
* `average-household-size.csv` <http://statistics.gov.scot/data/average-household-size> The average number of people per household in each council area and in Scotland.
* `business-site-counts.csv` <http://statistics.gov.scot/data/business-site-counts> Number of business sites by employee size band.
* `employment.csv` <http://statistics.gov.scot/data/employment> Employment level.
* `road-vehicles.csv` <http://statistics.gov.scot/data/road-vehicles> Road vehicle fuel consumption.

Additionally, there is spatial data for the Scottish local authorities.
These were adapted from Ordnance Survey Boundary Line data <https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/boundary-line.html>.


## Code

A sample `R` script is included for joining data together.
